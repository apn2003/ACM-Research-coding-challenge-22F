I decided to build a code that prints out a dictionary with the Make and the most expensive Model in the dataset for that Make. I used nested while loops to iterate through the dataset and an array which included the names of all the Makes in the dataset. The price was edited to be in int format and then compared to multiple values to figure out which price was the highest. The Model of the car corresponding to that price was made the value in a dictionary with the Make of the Model being its key.
